# Static Comp

## Introduction
This weekend-long project was an opportunity to play with responsive design and flex some html and css muscles. We were provided with a [project spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp) and a desktop version a generic website to match. The objective of the project was to build something that respected the integrity of the original design, while not necessarily matching the font, copy, and images. Because the spec was a fairly formal, business-style website, I created a website for a conference. 

[Fetch Conference 2021](https://clairefields15.github.io/static-comp/) is, regrettably, not a real conference, but I hope you enjoy looking through the schedule of events and dog-earing which talks you might like to attend over the long weekend.

## Features
This is a fully responsive static site that was built mobile-first.

Adding JavaScript was not a requirement of the project, but I added a tiny bit, just so that you can see this mobile navigation bar in action.

The website is fully responsive and utilizes media queries to set css rules across several breakpoints:

## Future Additions
I am unlikely to add any future additions to this project, but some avenues for improvement include small css animations to improve the UI such as ripples on buttons in mobile view.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
